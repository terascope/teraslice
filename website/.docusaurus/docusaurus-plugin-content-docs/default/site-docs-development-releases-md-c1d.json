  "description": "A Teraslice \"release\" is not just the teraslice package alone but a set of version locked packages that work together with teraslice. This is important to note since the packages can change and be released often, but a release undergoes QA. Each release should be attached to a Github Milestone and all issues \"fixed\" since the previous release should be linked to that Milestone.",
