> Flexible Lucene-like evaluator and language parser

Note: If importing this package into a repo that uses yarn PnP, `ts-pegjs` must also be declared as a dependency and then 'unplugged'. See https://github.com/terascope/teraslice/issues/3724

```
yarn add xlucene-parser
yarn add ts-pegjs
yarn unplug ts-pegjs
```

The -A or -R flags may be needed with `unplug` dependending on your workspace structure.
