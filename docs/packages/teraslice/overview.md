> Distributed computing platform for processing JSON data

Teraslice is an open source, distributed computing platform for processing JSON data stored in Elasticsearch. It can be used for many tasks but is particularly adept at migrating and transforming data within and between Elasticsearch clusters and other data stores. It was born and bred in an environment that regularly sees billions of pieces of data per day and is capable of processing millions of records per second.

Here are a few tasks it can help you with:

  * Data ingest from Kafka to Elasticsearch
  * Reindexing data at high volumes
  * Moving data between clusters
  * Moving data out of Elasticsearch into other systems
  * Automatic syncing of data from Elasticsearch to other systems
  * Exporting data to files
  * Importing data from a previous export
  * Periodic processing of data stored in an index

In Teraslice you define jobs that specify a pipeline of work to be applied to a slice of data. That work will execute concurrently across many workers to achieve very high re-processing throughput.

The only requirement that Teraslice makes is that the data is sliceable using date ranges. So as long as your index has a date field that varies across records then you can use it to slice things up and concurrently reprocess the data in the index.

Jobs are specified as simple JSON documents. Here's a simple reindexing example.

```json
{
    "name": "Reindex",
    "lifecycle": "once",
    "workers": 1,
    "assets": ["elasticsearch"],
    "operations": [
        {
          "_op": "elasticsearch_reader",
          "index": "example-logs",
          "type": "logs",
          "size": 10000,
          "date_field_name": "created",
          "full_response": true
        },
        {
            "_op": "elasticsearch_index_selector",
            "type": "change",
            "index": "example-logs-new",
            "id_field": "_key"
        },
        {
          "_op": "elasticsearch_bulk",
          "size": 10000
        }
    ]
}
```

In this instance all the operations that are performed are provided by Teraslice. The elasticsearch_reader takes a date range and slices up the index so that it can be reprocessed. The result of that is fed to elasticsearch_index_selector that takes the incoming data and bundles it into a bulk request that is then sent to the cluster using elasticsearch_bulk_insert.

Operations are nothing more than Javascript modules and writing your own is easy so custom code can be inserted in the operations flow as needed.

## Status

Teraslice is currently in alpha status. Single node deployment and clustering support are functional and being refined. APIs are usable but will still be evolving as we work toward a production release. See the list of open issues for other limitations.

## Getting Started

Teraslice is written in Node.js and has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X.

### Installation ###

```sh
# Install teraslice globally
npm install --global teraslice
# Or with yarn
yarn global add teraslice
```
