title: Teraslice Configuration
sidebar_label: Configuration
---

This entails information on how to set your configuration for teraslice itself. You may either set a config.json or config.yaml file at the root of teraslice or pass in the config file at startup time with the -c flag and the path to the file

#### Example Config

```yaml
terafoundation:
    environment: 'development'
    # the log level to use
    log_level: info
    connectors:
        # ***********************
        # Elastic Search Configuration
        # ***********************
        elasticsearch:
            default:
                host:
                    - "127.0.0.1:9200"
                keepAlive: true
                apiVersion: '6.5'
                maxRetries: 5
                maxSockets: 20

        # ***********************
        # Kafka Configuration
        # ***********************
        kafka:
            default:
                brokers:
                    - "kafka:9092"
teraslice:
    master: true
    master_hostname: "127.0.0.1"
    workers: 8
    name: "teracluster"
    assets_directory: /path/to/assets

    # change the default timeouts
    action_timeout: 20000
    shutdown_timeout: 60000

```

The configuration file essentially has two main fields, configuration for teraslice and for terafoundation which is a module that sits below it. terafoundation handles clustering/worker creation, general errors and database connection instantiation

### Connectors

The connectors is an object whose keys correspond to supported databases. Those keys should be set to an object which holds
endpoints, allowing you to specify multiple connections and connection configurations for each database.

For Example

```yaml
# ...
terafoundation:
    # ...
    connectors:
        elasticsearch:
            default:
                host:
                    - '127.0.0.1:9200'
                keepAlive: false
                maxRetries: 5
                maxSockets: 20
            secondar:
                host:
                    - 'some-other-ip:9200'
                apiVersion: '6.5'
                maxRetries: 0
        statsd:
            default:
            host: '127.0.0.1'
            mock: false
        mongodb:
            default:
            servers: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test'
        redis:
            default:
            host: '127.0.0.1'
# ...
```

In this example we specify four different connections: elasticsearch, statsd, mongod, and redis. We follow an idiom of naming the primary endpoint for each of them to be called `default`. Within each endpoint you may create custom configurations that will be validated against the defaults specified in node_modules/terafoundation/lib/connectors. As noted above, in elasticsearch there is the `default` endpoint and the `secondary` endpoint which connects to a different elasticsearch cluster each having different configurations. These different endpoints can be retrieved through terafoundations's api.

## Configuration Single Node / Cluster Master

Teraslice requires a configuration file in order to run. The configuration file defines your service connections and system level configurations.

This configuration example defines a single connection to Elasticsearch on localhost with 8 workers available to Teraslice.

The cluster configuration defines this node as a master node. The node will still have workers
available and this configuration is sufficient to do useful work if you don't have multiple
nodes available. The workers will connect to the master on localhost and do work just as if they were in a real cluster.

```yaml
teraslice:
    workers: 8
    master: true
    master_hostname: "127.0.0.1"
    name: "teracluster"

terafoundation:
    environment: 'development'
    log_path: '/path/to/logs'

    connectors:
        elasticsearch:
            default:
                host:
                    - "localhost:9200"
```

## Configuration Cluster Worker Node

Configuration for a worker node is very similar. You just set 'master' to false and provide the IP address where the master node can be located.

```yaml
teraslice:
    workers: 8
    master: false
    master_hostname: "YOUR_MASTER_IP"
    name: "teracluster"

terafoundation:
    environment: 'development'
    log_path: '/path/to/logs'

    connectors:
        elasticsearch:
            default:
                host:
                    - "YOUR_MASTER_IP":9200
```
