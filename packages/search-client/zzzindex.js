/**
 * meeting notes w/Jared
 *
 * search-clients
 * - got client
 * - elasticsearch client - or a different name?
 *
 * test-helper-utils - these are low level where as teraslice-test-harness is op specific for ts
 * - elasticsearch test helpers
 * - random data thing & we could
 *   use turf for the geo stuff
 *   & look at faker
 *   & then standard assets
 *   could use/reference it
 *
 * elasticsearch-store
 * - can leave as is and deprecate unless same naming or stores are desired for
 *   teraslice in future - and move index manager/model/store to spaces
